# LevelUp1
As of early 2025, you will find here:
1) my schoolwork from the University of Helsinki's Open Online Courses:
    Introduction to Programming (01 to 07)
    Advanced Course in Programming (08 to 14)
...both of which I completed in autumn 2024, receiving the highest possible grade. 
The files have been organised to only contain what I made and any assets needed to run the files.
(Some of the assets were duplicates or mildly modified across different exercises, so I cannot guarantee that every single file works precisely as it did when I was doing the course, but the vast majority of them absolutely should.)


2) the FAFO folder which contains, as the name indicates, some abominations that were birthed while procrastinating from schoolwork or otherwise playing around. They can date from anywhere between September 2024 and now.
